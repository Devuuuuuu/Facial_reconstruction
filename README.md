# Facial_reconstruction

There are 2 python files, 1 png file

1) visuals.py<br>
   a) This file gives a 3d visualization of the dicom file<br>
   b) Here you'll find dicom_file = "dicom_file_name.dcm" in the 6th line<br>
   c) You need to replace that with the DICOM file<br>
   e) Here, in github repo, I couldn't add DICOM file because it was way too big, even after compression, it was big...so you need to separately install that<br>
   d) Finally, after getting the DICOM file, your output would be a 3d view of the facial structure<br>
   f) Now, the thing you need to do is, get a proper frontfaced angle of that structured, such that the face is visible to your side...take a snapshot or screenshot and it would be saved in png or jpg format<br>
   g) An example image is mentioned in the repository as face_img.png<br><br>

3) tester.py<br>
   a) After having a png or any image file, you need to replace
